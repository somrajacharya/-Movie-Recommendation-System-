# -Movie-Recommendation-System-
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences and past ratings. The system processes data from the MovieLens dataset using libraries like pandas and NumPy, and computes similarity between users using cosine similarity. It generates personalized recommendations by identifying users with similar tastes and suggesting highly rated movies they havenâ€™t seen yet. The project includes data preprocessing, user-movie matrix construction, similarity calculations, and ranking logic, along with visualizations for better understanding. It demonstrates core machine learning and data analysis concepts and can be further extended using content-based or hybrid recommendation methods.
